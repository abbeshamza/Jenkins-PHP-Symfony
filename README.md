PHP-Jenkins + Symfony
=====================

* The initial build script was generated by PHP Project Wizard.  
* It's been modified to run phpunit from the app directory.
* The initial phpunit.dist.xml came with Symfony 2.0.3.
* It's been modified to include a logging target that the build tools expect to exist.  
* This target was provided by php-jenkins.org and it was modified to reflect the different location of the build directory
